# Top-Level Navigation

## 1. **Home**

**Purpose:** Landing page and “energy snapshot” of you and the system.

- Short intro: who you are, what you do.
- High-level links into Work / Discover / Philosophy.
- Maybe 2–3 featured projects + 1–2 featured essays.
- Clear CTAs: “View Projects”, “Work With Me”, “Contact”.

---

## 2. **Work**

Practical, professional “Di / Earth” side: what you **build**.

### 2.1 **Projects**

- Case studies of real systems shipped.
- Each project = one markdown:

  - problem → solution → architecture → results → lessons.
  - mix of public and private (private gated by login).

- Contains things like:

  - AI Automation Suite
  - Wood Identification AI
  - System Monitor
  - Judicial V2T (private)

**Use:** primary reference for clients/employers to see capability in production contexts.

---

### 2.2 **Labs**

Explorations, prototypes, and technical experiments.

- Smaller, focused artefacts:

  - prototypes,
  - evaluation tools,
  - scripts/utilities,
  - creative experiments with AI.

- Less polished than Projects; more honest, in-progress work.
- Examples:

  - Automation tools
  - Code snippets
  - Creative experiments
  - AI prototypes

**Use:** show how you think, test ideas, and learn — without the overhead of full case studies.

---

### 2.3 **Products / Templates** (optional but you mentioned this)

If you ever want a distinct place for “reusable things people can adopt”:

- Open-source tools, templates, starter repos.
- Reusable workflow engines, dashboards, configs.
- Could be either:

  - a sub-tab under Work, or
  - just a **tag** within Projects/Labs (no extra route).

---

## 3. **Discover**

Curated “Ren / Human world” — what you **share** to teach, document, and connect.

### 3.1 **Blog**

Main writing stream: engineering, evaluation, ops, and some philosophical pieces that are still **applied**.

You can organize **conceptually** into categories while keeping files flat:

- **Engineering & Infrastructure**

  - system design notes
  - observability, MLOps, deployment stories

- **Evaluation & LLMOps**

  - metrics, eval frameworks, drift, logging

- **Ethics in Practice**

  - ethics in LLM evals
  - justice in AI systems (if it feels more applied than manifesto-ish)

- **Process & Decision Logs**

  - “Decision Log” posts
  - how/why you made certain architectural choices

- **Calm Technology & UX**

  - attention, calm systems, dashboards that don’t scream

- **Personal / Meta Notes (optional)**

  - softer reflections that aren’t pure philosophy, but still relevant to work/life.

**Use:** ongoing log of thinking and practice – the “journal of record” for your engineering life.

---

### 3.2 **Library**

Your **learning archive** – what you absorb and how you digest it.

- **Reading List / Book & Paper Notes**

  - books and papers + commentary & summaries.

- **Media Kit**

  - official bio, headshot, logo, palette, font choices.

- **Press / Talks**

  - talks, podcasts, interviews, conference appearances.

- **Tools & Frameworks**

  - current stack list + why you prefer certain tools.

- **Research Notes** (can be private)

  - rough, working notes, experiments, partial analyses.

**Use:** shows the **inputs** to your thinking – where your ideas come from.

---

### 3.3 **People**

Profiles of thinkers, engineers, historical figures, and mentors (dead or alive) who shaped your view.

- Each person:

  - who they are,
  - what you learned from them,
  - how they influence your engineering or philosophy.

- E.g. Alan Turing, Martin Kleppmann, Amber Case, Donella Meadows, etc.

**Use:** “intellectual lineage” — visitors see who you’re in conversation with across time.

---

## 4. **Philosophy**

Your **Tian / Heaven** layer and inner operating system: values, mindset, Taoism, TCM, BaZi, archetypes, etc.

You said: keep everything here and **remove work + systems** because those are covered elsewhere. So Philosophy becomes:

### 4.1 **Mind & Attention**

- Personality architecture (INTP, Big Five).
- Attention, distraction, information diets.
- Mental models, meta-cognition, clarity, self-awareness.
- How you design your mental environment for calm systems.

---

### 4.2 **Body & Health**

- TCM-inspired health / energy management (without making health claims).
- Sleep, rhythm, pacing of work.
- Practices like qigong, breathwork, embodied rituals that support your engineering.

---

### 4.3 **Ethics & Justice**

- Justice manifesto.
- Deep reflections on fairness, power, consent, privacy.
- How you think about responsibility as an engineer.
- Cross-link with practical ethics posts in Blog, but here it’s the **charter**, not the case studies.

---

### 4.4 **Archetypes & Symbolic Systems**

- Tarot as system metaphor.
- Numerology as pattern language.
- BaZi structural analysis (private content lives here too).
- Wuxing (Five Elements) as a way to think about balance in systems and in life.
- This is explicitly **symbolic / metaphorical**, not predictive.

---

### 4.5 **Practice & Ritual**

- Your day/week structure.
- Reflection and journaling systems.
- Personal decision frameworks (e.g. how you decide what to work on).
- Integration of work-life philosophy into real routines.

---

## 5. **Timeline**

Chronological log of **milestones**.

- Releases (Portfolio v2, major rewrites).
- Significant project launches.
- Speaking engagements and life/career transitions (if you want).
- Each entry: short note + link to related project/blog post if relevant.

**Use:** a quick way to see how your work evolved over time.

---

## 6. **Services**

For people who want to work with you.

- Clear list of **service types**:

  - Applied AI prototyping
  - On-prem deployment & MLOps
  - Automation audits
  - Technical writing & training

- Engagement models:

  - project-based, retainers, workshops.

- Process overview:

  - discovery → audit → build → handover.

- Link to Contact for next step.

**Use:** business-facing — this is where someone decides “Should we hire this person?”.

---

## 7. **Resume**

Compact but complete **professional profile**.

- PDF download.
- Inline version with experience, skills, education, certifications, languages, interests.
- Possibly link out to highlight projects / blog posts for deeper reading.

**Use:** quick due-diligence page for recruiters and clients.

---

## 8. **Contact**

Entry point for **human interaction**.

- Contact form or email link.
- Office hours, response expectations, time zone.
- Privacy note: how you handle messages.

### 8.1 **Testimonials**

- Short quotes from collaborators/clients (when you have them).
- Ideally grouped by type (consulting, teaching, collaboration).
- Lives under Contact because it supports the “reach out” decision.

**Use:** social proof that matches the calm, no-hype tone.

---

## 9. **About**

Meta-layer about **you and the site** — the governance + foundation.

### 9.1 **About Me**

- Personal story + profile (already written).
- Who you are, what you care about, how you think.

---

### 9.2 **Foundation**

The “site constitution” and policies. This can either be:

- A single index page explaining what “Foundation” is, **plus**:

  - Accessibility statement
  - Privacy policy
  - Cookie policy
  - Terms of service
  - Features & system overview

- Or each of those as separate pages under Foundation.

**Use:** trust + transparency + technical underpinnings.

---

### 9.3 **FAQ**

- Common questions:

  - “Can we work together on X?”
  - “What kind of projects do you avoid?”
  - “What’s your typical process / timeline?”
  - “How do you think about ethics and data privacy?”
  - “Are you open to speaking / teaching?”

- Can also include questions about your philosophy, health routines, and how you manage energy — if you want.

---

### 9.4 **Credits**

- Acknowledgment of tools, libraries, thinkers.
- Mentions of open-source tech used in the site.
- Personal gratitude.

**Use:** closes the loop with humility — this is the “behind the system” page.

---

## Optional Structural Tags (Not Separate Nav Tabs)

You can still **tag** content across these sections to create cross-cutting views without changing the nav:

- `meta`: anything reflecting on your own system / self.
- `calm-technology`
- `evaluation`
- `tcm`
- `justice`
- `practice`
- `private`: used only in front-matter + visibility badge.
